# Running an Initial Scan

* **Getting Started**:
  * **Set Up**: Configure the tool to work with your project’s environment. This might include connecting it to your blockchain nodes or development environment.
  * **Choose Chains**: Select which blockchains you want to scan, whether it’s just Ethereum or multiple networks.
  * **Define Contract Type**: Specify the type of contract (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721) so the tool can apply the right checks.
  * **Adjust Scan Settings**: You can tailor the scan’s depth and focus, choosing how detailed you want it to be.
* **Running the Scan**:
  * **Launch the Scan**: Start the scan, and the tool will begin checking for issues across the selected chains. You’ll see live progress updates so you know what’s happening.
  * **Troubleshoot if Needed**: If any issues arise, such as network errors or configuration issues, the tool offers tips to help resolve them.
* **Understanding Results**:
  * **View the Report**: Once the scan is done, you’ll get a report with a clear summary of detected issues, ranked by severity (e.g., high, medium, low) to help you prioritize.
  * **Actionable Insights**: Each issue includes recommended fixes, so you know exactly what steps to take to improve security.
  * **Shareable Reports**: Export the report in formats like PDF or CSV to share with team members, investors, or auditors.
* **What’s Next**: After reviewing the results, you can address the identified issues, make improvements, and run follow-up scans as needed. If you need further help, OXAudit support can provide additional guidance.
