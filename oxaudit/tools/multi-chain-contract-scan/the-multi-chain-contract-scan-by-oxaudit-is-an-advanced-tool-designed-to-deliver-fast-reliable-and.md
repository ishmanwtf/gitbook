The **Multi-chain Contract Scan** by OXAUDIT provides fast and thorough security checks for smart contracts across multiple blockchains. It delivers instant insights into potential vulnerabilities, giving users a clear snapshot of security risks in seconds.

**The primary purpose of the Multi-Chain Contract Scan is to:**

1. **Streamline Security Checks:** Offer real-time analysis of smart contracts, reducing the time and effort required for manual audits.
2. **Enhance Transparency:** Empower users with clear, actionable information about contract vulnerabilities, ownership structures, and trading limitations.
3. **Promote Security Awareness:** Highlight potential red flags that could pose risks to funds, transactions, or overall blockchain integrity.
4. **Support Multi-Chain Projects:** Ensure consistent and effective security evaluations across various blockchain ecosystems.

## **Key Features of the Multi-Chain Contract Scan**

1. **Verified Contract:** Ensures the contract code is publicly accessible and verified. Contracts without verification are flagged as a major red flag, emphasizing the importance of transparency.
2. **Proxy & Mint Risks:** Detects whether the contract includes mechanisms allowing modifications post-deployment, such as proxy contracts or minting functions. These features are carefully analyzed for potential abuse or manipulation.
3. **Ownership Games:** Examines the ownership structure to identify transparency or hidden risks. It flags contracts with obscure or changeable ownership settings that might compromise user trust.
4. **Honeypot Check:** Flags contracts exhibiting characteristics of honeypots—malicious designs intended to trap user funds. This feature helps users avoid fraudulent contracts.
5. **Trading Freedom:** Scans for trading limitations like sell restrictions, transfer pauses, or other actions that might limit a user’s ability to freely trade tokens.
