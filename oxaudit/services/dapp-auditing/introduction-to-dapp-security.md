# Introduction to DApp Security

Decentralized Applications, or **DApps**, are applications that run on a blockchain network rather than a centralized server. They often include smart contracts on the back end and an accessible front end for users. Because DApps interact with valuable assets and user data, **DApp security** is critical to protect both the application and its users from potential risks.

* **Why is DApp Security Critical?**
  * DApps are often open-source, meaning anyone can inspect their code. While this promotes transparency, it also allows attackers to study the code for vulnerabilities.
  * DApps have both a **front end** (the user interface) and a **back end** (often a smart contract on a blockchain). This dual nature introduces unique security challenges that traditional apps don’t face, such as needing to protect both the blockchain-based logic and the user-facing interface.
  * Since DApps handle digital assets, a security breach could lead to financial losses for users and damage to the project’s reputation.
