# Common Risks in DApp Development

DApp security risks come from various sources. Below are some common threats that developers and auditors need to address to ensure a safe experience for users.

* **Phishing Attacks**:
  * Attackers may create fake versions of a DApp’s front end to trick users into entering their private keys or personal information.
  * This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and theft of funds. Phishing is particularly dangerous in decentralized systems, where users are responsible for their own security.
* **Front-End Vulnerabilities**:
  * The front end of a DApp is often hosted off-chain, such as on a website. This can make it vulnerable to traditional web-based attacks, like cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
  * These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to manipulate the user interface, intercept data, or even redirect users to malicious sites.
* **Unprotected APIs**:
  * DApps frequently interact with external APIs to pull data or communicate with blockchain networks. If these APIs are not properly secured, attackers can exploit them to intercept or alter data.
  * An unprotected API can allow unauthorized access to the DApp’s functionalities or expose sensitive information about the application and its users.
