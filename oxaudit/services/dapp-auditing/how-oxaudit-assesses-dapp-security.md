# How OXAudit Assesses DApp Security

OXAudit provides a tailored auditing process specifically designed to address the unique security needs of DApps. The audit process covers multiple layers of the DApp, ensuring that both the front end and back end are secure. Here’s how OXAudit’s audit process works for DApps:

* **Smart Contract Review**:
  * OXAudit starts by reviewing the DApp’s smart contracts. This involves scanning for vulnerabilities in the code, testing logic, and ensuring compliance with blockchain standards.
  * The goal is to ensure that the smart contracts behave as intended and are free from security issues that could lead to unauthorized access or asset theft.
* **API Testing**:
  * APIs are often the bridge between a DApp’s front end and back end, making them critical for the app’s functionality. OXAudit tests these APIs to identify and fix any unprotected endpoints or data exposure risks.
  * The audit team ensures that APIs only allow authorized requests and don’t expose sensitive information, making them resistant to manipulation or unauthorized access.
* **Front-End Security Checks**:
  * OXAudit also focuses on the front end, which users interact with directly. This part of the audit includes checking for web-specific vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking.
  * Front-end security checks ensure that the DApp’s user interface is safe and cannot be exploited by malicious actors to trick users or steal information.
