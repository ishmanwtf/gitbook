# Layer 2 Scaling Audits

As Ethereum and other blockchain platforms seek scalability solutions, Layer 2 technologies play a critical role. These solutions, however, introduce new complexities and potential security risks.

## **Our Approach:** <a href="#our-approach" id="our-approach"></a>

* **Specialized Expertise**: Our auditors possess deep knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions, including optimistic rollups, zk-rollups, and sidechains, enabling them to identify unique vulnerabilities associated with these technologies.
* **Security and Compatibility**: We ensure that Layer 2 solutions are not only secure in their own right but also maintain secure interactions with the main blockchain (Layer 1), preserving the integrity of cross-layer transactions.
* **Performance Evaluation**: Our audits also review the scalability solution's impact on performance, ensuring that it enhances transaction throughput without compromising security.
