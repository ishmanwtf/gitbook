# What is a Penetration Testing

**Penetration testing**, also known as "pen testing," is a simulated cyberattack on a system, network, or application to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. In the context of blockchain and DApps, penetration testing helps strengthen the security of decentralized systems by uncovering potential weaknesses. OXAudit’s penetration testing service simulates various types of attacks to help projects better protect their assets and users.

## **Simulated Attack Scenarios**

OXAudit’s penetration testing simulates real-world attack scenarios, allowing clients to see how their systems would hold up against actual threats. Here are some types of attacks commonly simulated during a penetration test:

* **Brute Force Attacks**:
  * In a brute force attack, an attacker attempts to gain access to accounts or data by trying many different combinations of passwords or keys. Penetration tests simulate brute force attacks to see if systems are vulnerable to these attempts.
  * This helps identify weaknesses in authentication systems and highlights the importance of strong passwords or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* **SQL Injection**:
  * SQL injection is a type of attack where an attacker inserts malicious code into a database query, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  * Although SQL injection is more common in traditional web apps, some blockchain applications may still have data storage systems vulnerable to this kind of attack. Penetration testing ensures that any database-related functions are protected against injection attacks.
* **Phishing Attacks**:
  * Phishing attacks involve tricking users into providing sensitive information, such as private keys or passwords, by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.
  * In a simulated phishing attack, the pen testing team sends fake emails or messages to test if users or team members are vulnerable to social engineering. This helps organizations identify gaps in user training and awareness.
