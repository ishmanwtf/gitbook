# What is a Layer 2 Security

**Layer 2 solutions** are designed to help blockchains handle more transactions by building on top of the main (Layer 1) blockchain. They provide a way to scale blockchain networks, making them faster and more affordable for users. However, with these benefits come new security challenges.

* **Scalability and Security**:
  * Layer 2 solutions allow for increased **scalability** by processing transactions off the main chain, which reduces congestion and lowers fees.
  * However, this added scalability often comes with **trade-offs** in terms of security. Because transactions are happening outside of the main blockchain, thereâ€™s a need for extra checks to ensure these transactions are still secure and properly validated.
  * Balancing scalability and security is crucial. While Layer 2 solutions make blockchain technology more accessible, they introduce new points of vulnerability that must be managed carefully.
