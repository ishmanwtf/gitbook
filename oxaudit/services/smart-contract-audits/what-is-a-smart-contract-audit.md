**Purpose**: A smart contract audit is a detailed examination of the contract’s code to ensure it operates securely and as intended. Since smart contracts are immutable once deployed (i.e., cannot be changed without complex processes), it’s crucial to identify and fix any vulnerabilities beforehand. OXAudit performs these audits to protect blockchain projects from potential security risks and ensure they meet high standards of reliability and trust.

* **Why It’s Needed**: Blockchain projects handle significant financial transactions and assets, making them high-value targets for attackers. A thorough audit helps prevent costly exploits, safeguards user funds, and strengthens the project’s reputation.
* **Key Benefits**:
  * **Risk Reduction**: An audit reduces the risk of hacks or malicious attacks.
  * **Trust Building**: Users and investors gain confidence in projects that prioritize security.
  * **Compliance**: In some cases, an audit may help with regulatory compliance or meet industry standards for security.
