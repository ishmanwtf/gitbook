# Audit Process Overview

OXAudit follows a structured, step-by-step process to ensure blockchain projects are secure and ready for launch. Here’s how it works:

1. **Initial Assessment**: We start by understanding the project’s main functions and security needs, so we can focus on the critical areas.
2. **Automated Scanning**: Using advanced tools, we scan the code for common security issues like reentrancy attacks and access control flaws.
3. **Manual Code Review**: Our security experts go through the code in detail, looking for complex vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
4. **Business Logic Testing**: We test the project’s key functions to ensure they work correctly and can’t be exploited.
5. **Stress Testing**: We simulate high usage to see how the project performs under real-world conditions, checking for any weaknesses.
6. **Multi-Chain Checks** (if needed): For projects on multiple blockchains, we make sure security is consistent across all networks.
7. **Comprehensive Reporting**: We provide a clear report with all issues found, organized by severity, and include practical steps for fixing them.
8. **Remediation Support and Re-Testing**: We help the team apply fixes and re-test to make sure issues are resolved.
9. **Ongoing Monitoring** (optional): For long-term security, we offer continuous monitoring and periodic checks to keep the project protected as it grows.

This process gives projects a strong security foundation, ready for a successful and safe launch, with the option to stay secure over time.
