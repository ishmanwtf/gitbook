# DApp Auditing

DApps represent a significant advancement in how users interact with blockchain technologies, offering decentralized services across finance, gaming, and beyond. Securing these applications requires a holistic approach, given their interaction with smart contracts and external systems.

#### **Our Approach:** <a href="#our-approach" id="our-approach"></a>

* **End-to-End Security**: Our dApp audits cover the entire stack, from the smart contracts to the frontend interface, assessing vulnerabilities in code, potential attack vectors, and user security.
* **User Interaction Analysis**: We closely examine how users interact with the dApp, identifying UI/UX elements that could lead to unintended actions or vulnerabilities.
* **Continuous Monitoring**: Given the dynamic nature of dApps, we offer ongoing monitoring services to ensure security against new threats as the dApp evolves.
