# Revenue Sharing Model

At OXAudit, we view our community as essential partners in the project's growth. The **Revenue Sharing Model** is designed to distribute a share of our revenue back to token holders as a gesture of appreciation and inclusivity. This model embodies fairness and transparency, ensuring that everyone who believes in OXAudit’s mission and holds our tokens reaps tangible rewards. By creating a direct connection between the success of the company and its token holders, we aim to foster long-term alignment and mutual trust within the ecosystem.

Our goal is simple: transform token holding into a rewarding experience, where success is not just shared—it’s built collaboratively.
