# Tiers

The tiered system for revenue sharing is designed to ensure proportional rewards based on token holdings. Here’s how the tiers work:

1. **Tier 1: Key Stakeholders**
   * **Eligibility:** Holding more than **2%** of the total token supply.
   * **Rewards:** Priority access to the largest share of the revenue pool. These stakeholders are crucial to the project’s foundation and are rewarded for their commitment and contribution.
2. **Tier 2: Mid-Level Supporters**
   * **Eligibility:** Holding more than **1%** but less than **2%** of the total token supply.
   * **Rewards:** Significant participation in the revenue pool, designed to recognize medium-scale investors who actively support OXAudit’s ecosystem.
3. **Tier 3: Inclusive Contributors**
   * **Eligibility:** Holding at least **0.5%** of the total token supply.
   * **Rewards:** Access to a base-level revenue share, ensuring smaller holders are not left out of the growth and benefits of the project.

This **progressive structure** not only promotes fairness but also incentivizes larger holdings, ensuring both inclusivity and substantial rewards for long-term supporters.
