# Overview

The Revenue Sharing Model channels a portion of OXAudit’s revenue streams into a dedicated reward pool for token holders. This pool is funded through earnings from various services, including **smart contract audits, DApp security assessments, API subscriptions**, and other premium offerings.

This structured approach ensures that as OXAudit grows, so does the value delivered to its community. Instead of simply holding tokens, participants actively partake in the project's financial success, turning loyalty and trust into a rewarding partnership.

Our focus isn’t just on rewarding holders—it’s about creating a mechanism that incentivizes long-term commitment, making OXAudit’s growth a shared achievement.
