# Benefits to Holders

Holding OXAudit tokens is not just about financial gain—it’s about being part of a shared journey. Here’s why the Revenue Sharing Model is valuable:

1. **Passive Income:**
   * Token holders receive a steady income without requiring any additional effort, making it a true passive earning mechanism.
2. **Alignment with Success:**
   * As OXAudit thrives, so do token holders. The model ensures that the community benefits directly from the company’s growth.
3. **Encourages Long-Term Holding:**
   * The tiered structure incentivizes larger and longer holdings, promoting stability in the token economy and minimizing market volatility.
4. **Inclusivity:**
   * By setting a low threshold for participation, even smaller holders have a stake in the project’s success, fostering a sense of collective growth.
5. **Strategic Appeal to Investors:**
   * The Revenue Sharing Model makes OXAudit tokens attractive to both retail and institutional investors, offering tangible rewards beyond speculative value.
6. **Community Empowerment:**
   * Beyond financial rewards, the model strengthens community engagement, turning holders into true stakeholders in OXAudit’s mission.
