# Distribution Mechanics

To ensure a smooth and equitable distribution process, weâ€™ve implemented clear mechanics powered by smart contracts:

1. **Revenue Sources:**
   * Rewards come from multiple streams, including audits, API integrations, and other OXAudit services. As these streams diversify and expand, the reward pool will grow proportionally.
2. **Automated Distribution:**
   * A secure and **fully automated smart contract** handles the revenue sharing process, eliminating human errors and ensuring accuracy.
3. **Payout Frequency:**
   * Rewards are distributed **monthly**, providing regular, predictable income for token holders.
4. **Transparency in Operations:**
   * Every calculation, distribution, and detail is logged and displayed on the **OXAudit dashboard**, ensuring token holders have full visibility into the process.
5. **Dynamic Allocation:**
   * The reward pool allocation adapts based on the revenue generated and the number of participants, maintaining consistency and fairness.
